**Restaurant Introduction**

Chef Heidi Bjerkan opened Credo in 1998, making it "one of the oldest and longest-standing restaurants of its kind in the Nordics." She's been a pioneer in showcasing Norwegian flavors and sourcing local, organic ingredients directly from farms—practices she championed decades before they became trendy.

The restaurant relocated in 2018 to Lilleby, outside Trondheim's city center. Bjerkan transformed a large industrial building into a "beautiful greenhouse-like restaurant, with lots of windows and glass walls," where she grows many menu ingredients on-site. The space includes a fig tree by the entrance and an herb garden in the rafters.

**Chef Profile**

Bjerkan represents "what it really means to be sustainable" in the culinary world. The Credo village compound also houses her casual restaurant Jossa, a ramen establishment, and a bakery, plus an educational classroom for her Geitmyra Credo project teaching children about food and sustainability.

The restaurant works closely with a local dairy farm, treating the cows as "integral team members" with individual portraits displayed in a wall of fame—a touching testament to her ingredient-focused philosophy.
